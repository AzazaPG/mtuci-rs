The error message is telling you that the `resize` method for the `Vec<T>` struct requires the type `T` to satisfy the `Clone` trait, but the type `T` in your code does not satisfy that trait.

To fix this error, you have a few options:

1. Use a different method that doesn't require the `Clone` trait: If you don't actually need to resize the vector, you can use other methods like `push` or `insert` to add elements to the vector individually.

2. Change the type `T` to a type that does satisfy the `Clone` trait: If you have control over the type `T`, you can make sure it implements the `Clone` trait by deriving it with `#[derive(Clone)]` or implementing the trait manually.

3. Use a different data structure that doesn't require the `Clone` trait: If resizing is a critical requirement for your use case and you can't change the type `T`, you can consider using a different data structure that doesn't require cloning, such as a linked list (`LinkedList`).

Here's an example of how you can derive the `Clone` trait for your custom type:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct MyStruct {
    // fields of your struct
}

// Then use MyStruct as T in your code
```

Remember, the specific solution will depend on your use case and requirements.
